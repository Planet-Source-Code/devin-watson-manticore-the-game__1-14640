## Manticore\! The Game


</div>

### Description

This is a (nearly) complete game, utilizing the Manticore 1.0 library and the RPG Data Objects Library 1.0. This was not completed for a reason, so that others can extend it and learn how to use Manticore and create games at the same time. Both Manticore 1.0 and RPG Data Objects Library are included, along with graphics from SpriteLib. If you make a game, get SpriteLib. It's free, and very slick. For more info on Manticore, go to http://www.crashlogix.com/manticore. Please vote also. I don't expect much response, but I do want feedback, as any *constructive* comments may help in the development of Manticore.
 
### More Info
 
Manticore 1.0 (included)

RPG Data Objects Library 1.0 (included)

Make sure you have properly registered Manticore.dll and vbRPG.dll using REGSVR32.EXE. Instructions are included in the zip (readme.txt). Also make sure you unzip everything with the correct subfolders for graphics and sounds.

I haven't had any side effects yet from this, and I've been running, recoding, and recompiling this thing for about a month or so, on and off.
