--------[Important Note]--------

In order for this program to run successfully,
you must first register vbRPG.dll (RPG Data Objects Library) and
Manticore.dll (Manticore 1.0) using REGSVR32.EXE. 

vbRPG.DLL is another ActiveX DLL which was created in
order to show how to extend Manticore without bloating
your application / game's source EXE. If you would like 
the source for this, e-mail me at dwatson@erols.com.

This is a real bare-bones demo in which I wanted to
show a more full game being developed using Manticore. It
is heavily commented (except for frmIntro, but it's really
easy to figure out), so if you want to extend it, go
right ahead.
